                            by age twelve Brian was playing drums, trombone, bass and euphonium. In interviews, Brian passionately tells how he was inspired 
                            by the iconic R&B-jazz-pop artists of the 1970s like Earth, Wind & Fire, Tower of Power, Chicago, David Sandborn and others.  He started
                            composing original music for his seventh grade piano recital and has not stopped since! Brian has over 30 Billboard No. 1 singles and an extensive

                        <p>Brian came onto the music scene in 1994 with his first ablum, Long Night Out. The demo was recorded in his college apartment and featured himself playing most 
                            of the instruments. Mesa/Bluemoon Recordings produced the final album and launched his career with a six-album contract. Over the years, Brian has collaborated with many artist and won numerous
