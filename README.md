# Introduction

This project was a prework assignment for a coding bootcamp. I made the page and updates prior to using GitHub, so there are no commits of my initial work.  As my coding skills improve, I may add additional features to the page or modify the layout. Any additional work on the page will be pushed to this repo.

# Description
This work is basic HTML page layout and CSS. It is my first fully developed webpage as a web development, coding student. I made the page using Bootstrap. This work is basic HTML and CSS layout.  It includes a navbar, main area with images, columns, floats and a footer.
